=== Nouns

Nouns in Ngujari refer to concepts which exist regardless of time.
Whereas a verb may specify an action, a noun refers to a concrete or
abstract _object_.

Structurally, a noun has a number of important properties. It must
assume one of the four _genders_, which then lead to different verb conjugations.
Nouns themselves must be declined according to _case_ and _plurality_.

Nouns can be used as part of a sentence without any supporting
morphemes; they do not require articles or modifiers to assume meaning.

Distributionally, nouns are the head of noun phrases, which are used as
arguments to verbs or in verbless constructions like the adjectival
predicate.

Predominantly, nouns are used as part of a verb phrase. They are
distinguished from other word classes by their ability to assume the
role of subject in such verb phrases, whereas constructions like gerunds
cannot.

Nouns are an open class, and new morphemes are added or derived on a
sporadic but frequent basis.

==== Proper nouns

Proper nouns are the names of specific objects, usually people. They are
most commonly found referring to members of the speaker's mob or
extended relationship network. However, many spiritual concepts in the
Dreamtime are referred to by proper nouns, which are capitalised for
clarity.

Proper nouns are structurally identical to regular nouns, except that
they lack the restriction on their final syllable and can end in a
consonant. In this instance, the usual suffixes are added to signify
case after reduplicating the final vowel in the noun.

====
*k-a girlipuu-girlipuu-ø Yurluj-urn naa yarr-a-m* +
_fall.aux-pst mango-pl-erg Yurluj-loc 1.val.2 fall-inan-3rd_ +
The mangoes fell on Yurluj.
====

However, proper nouns are unique in that they do not always require
inflection for grammatical case. Speakers will only decline proper nouns
if the sentence would be otherwise ambiguous. In the following sentence,
it is obvious that the proper noun takes the nominative position and it
is not inflected.

====
*j-aa munna-ø Parra naju-rna nakij-a-m* +
_move.aux-fut stream-erg Parra-nom rock-rev move-inan-3rd_ +
The stream will take Parra away from the rock.
====

The need to distinguish proper nouns using case inflections usually
arises when two proper nouns are in the same sentence.

====
*nn-i-yii Annurra-ø Najii-j yiinn-u-mi* +
_help.aux-pres-wimp Annurra-erg Najii-nom help-an-3rd_ +
Annurra should help Najii.
====

Even in circumstances where the meaning of the sentence would be
unambiguous without case inflection, the speaker may choose to inflect
if they are using a non-standard word order.

==== Pronouns

Pronouns behave almost exactly like nouns, with one exception:
indefinite and demonstrative pronouns do not decline for case.

===== Personal

Personal pronouns differ in three dimensions: person, plural, and
gender. All decline in the same way as regular nouns to indicate case.
The following tables list the pronouns:

.Child personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]
|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 1st person | jana     | janna | juu
| 2nd person | kurru    | kunii | kurlu
| 3rd person | nnarta   | nnaja | nni
|=======================================

.Adult personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]
|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 1st person | wa       | ja    | waya
| 2nd person | ku       | kuna  | kuu
| 3rd person | nna      | nnara | nnaa
|=======================================

.Inanimate personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]

|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 3rd person | nnu      | nnuka | nnunnu
|=======================================

When speaking of a mob's elders, a personal pronoun is never used. The
elder is always referred to by their honorific title.

===== Possessive

Possessive pronouns are formed through a suffix placed on the relevant
personal pronoun, but only for the child and adult genders. ForW
possession by elders, see *pronominal possession*. Inanimate objects
cannot be possessive. For a child, the suffix is _ra_ in first and
second person and _raa_ in third person. For an adult, the suffix is
_lu_ for all persons.

===== Interrogative

The interrogative pronouns are strongly affected by case, particularly
in the case of location and time. The basic pronouns are detailed in the
following table:

.Interrogative pronouns
[options="header"]
|====================
| meaning   | word
| where     | kiru
| when      | tuu
| who, what | pii
| how       | piima
| why       | wiirtak
| how many  | kirta
|====================

// TODO: cannot ask a question with just an interrogative pronoun like English. Instead have to say like "what (is it)?"

It is interesting to note that "how" is the same as "what" placed in the
instrumental case. The orientative and revertive cases can be applied to
_kiru_ ("where"), forming _kirurni_ ("whither/to where") and _kirunga_
("whence/from where"), as well as to _tuu_ ("when"), forming _tuurni_
("to when") and _tuunga_ ("from when").

===== Demonstrative

One set of demonstrative pronouns covers both proximal and distal
objects. Distinctions can be made in some cases between both gender and
number. The pronouns are found in the following table:

.Demonstrative pronouns
[options="header"]
|=================================================
| meaning          | singular | dual    | plural
| there            | naarla   | naarla  | naarla
| then             | yaji     | yaji    | yaji
| that (animate)   | yanna    | yannara | yannaa
| that (inanimate) | yannu    | yannuka | yannunnu
|=================================================

Again, the pronouns _naarla_ and _yaji_ can assume the orientative and
revertive cases.

===== Indefinite

The regular indefinite pronouns are formed through modifying the
interrogative pronouns by appending the correct word, representing
number. These words are listed in the following table:

.Indefinite pronouns
[options="header"]
|=================
| number   | word
| none     | nnayi
| singular | junga
| dual     | marri
| plural   | munaa
| all      | nnaya
|=================

For example, "everyone" would be expressed as _pii-nnaya_ and "some two
locations" as _kiru-marri_.

=== Verbs

A verb expresses an action or changing state.

Verbs in Ngujari are an open class, with infrequent additions to the
lexicon in the form of new or derived words.

Verbs can be split into three _classes_; each declining differently
but with no semantic meaning. Each class has a specific stem ending.
Verb roots lack a final consonant, meaning they must be conjugated in
order to appear in speech. The only effect of class is morphological.

In addition to its root lexeme, a verb is almost always accompanied by
an _auxiliary_: a separate word mandated by the verb's class which is
conjugated alongside the verb.

Each verb can be declined according to _person_ and _number_, marked
on the root, and _tense_ and _mood_, marked on the auxiliary. All
declensions are realised as agglutinative suffixes.

==== Class

The class of a verb is determined by its concluding phoneme. The three
classes occur in order of prevalence. A survey of all verb forms reveals
that the first and second classes account for more than 70% of all verbs
and a vast majority of the most frequently used, although otherwise
there is no difference in usage between the classes.

Class determines three aspects of usage:

* the particular suffixes of declension
* the form of the auxiliary particle
* the form of the negative particle

.Verb classes
[options="header"]
|================================================
| class  | ending | auxiliary | negative particle
| first  | -rr    | k-        | tu
| second | -j     | j-        | ti
| third  | -nn    | nn-       | wuu
|================================================

===== Irregular Auxiliaries

There are seven major verbs in Ngujari which have an irregular
auxiliary. Each auxiliary is a modified form of the base verb and must
be learned separately. Conjugation follows the verb's class and proceeds
as normal.

* _ngurr_: ngarr
* _gulwaj_: gulw
* _gurr_: garr
* _nnurr_: nnarr
* _wann_: wunn
* _yurr_: yirr
* _girr_: gurr

==== Dimensions

When declined as part of a sentence, the verb stem indicates the
_gender, person_, and _number_of an involved noun.

Person represents a perspective of the speaker: the relation they have
to the actor in the verb. If the speaker is performing the action, the
verb is in first person. If the speaker is directly addressing the
actor, it is in second person. And if the actor is someone else
entirely, the verb is in third person.

Number represents how many actors were involved. The verb may have been
performed by one actor, putting it in the singular number, two, putting
it in dual, or more than two, making it plural.

For transitive verbs and above, the agent of the clause determines these
dimensions.

====
*nn-uuki wa-ø wuwurna-j tinn-u-ø* +
_protect.AUX-FUT 1s-ERG coconuttree-NOM protect-an-1st_ +
I [an adult] will protect the coconut tree.

*nn-uuki nni-ø wuwurna-j tinn-arruu-mi* +
_protect.AUX-FUT 3pl.ch-ERG coconuttree-NOM protect-ch-3rd_ +
They [a group of children] will protect the coconut tree.

*nn-uuki wuwurna-ø nni-j tinn-aa-mi* +
_protext.aux-fut coconuttree-ERG 3pl-ch-NOM protect-inan-3rd_
====

For intransitive verbs, the subject determines the dimensions.

====
*wann-uu ku-j wann-u-ku* +
_know.AUX-PRES 2s-NOM know-AN-3rd_ +
You know.

|=================================================================================

==== Tense


===== Verbal Arguments

A verb's _valence_ determines the number of arguments it can take. For
example, a verb with a valence of two would take two nouns:

====
*k-a nnalji-ø pijtu-j nirr-u-m* +
_fight.AUX-PST dingo-ERG snake-NOM fight-AN-3RD_ +
The dingo fought the snake.
====

In addition to their valence, the arguments to verbs have restrictions
on their case. For the majority of transitive verbs, with a valence of
two, the arguments take the form of a subject and object. The cases are
determined by the alignment of the sentence.

However, this can differ, and some verbs have irregular argument cases.
This is especially true in the case of verbs relating to movement, which
instead take a subject and a location.

====
*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rn yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-loc run-an-1st_ +
I ran to the mountain [and ended up there].
====

When verbs take an argument in the locative case, the speaker can
instead use the revertive or orientative case for further control over
meaning.

====
*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rnu yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-ori run-an-1st_ +
I ran towards the mountain

*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rna yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-rev run-an-1st_ +
I ran away from the mountain
====

===== Valence Modification

All verbs have a _default valence_: the number of arguments it takes
without modification. Most verbs are transitive, but valences can span
between avalent (taking no arguments) and quadrivalent (taking four).

However, many verbs are not restricted to their default valence, and can
take different numbers of arguments. These configurations cause the verb
to take on different meanings. A verb will have a minimum and maximum
valence, and cannot take on arguments outside of this range.

====
*j-i wa-j kuma-l wuj-u-ø* +
_hold.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc hold-an-1st_ +
I hold you

*j-i wa-j kuma-l wirra-yi naa wuj-u-ø* +
_hold.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc blood-com 2.val.3 hold-an-1st_ +
I love you (lit. I hold blood for you)
====

For a transitive verb, it is common to find a configuration with a third
argument in the comitative case, representing the means with which the
action occurred.

For example, the verb _wurr_ is by default avalent, taking no arguments.
In this case, it means "it is electrically storming". However, modifying
its valence to one changes its meaning to "to be struck by lightning",
and a valence of two allows it to mean "to strike". No other number of
arguments is allowed. Therefore, it has a minimum valence of zero and
maximum valence of two.

Valence modification occurs through special particles. These particles
typically immediately precede the modified verb, and indicate they take
an unusual number of arguments. A verb without a particle has default
valence.

.Valence modifiers
[cols="s,,,,,",options="header"]
|====================================================
|        5+| target
| default s| 0      s| 1     s| 2   s| 3     s| 4
| 0        | -       | wi     | ji   | murnu  | yurnu
| 1        | wi      | _      | naa  | naki   | mu
| 2        | waa     | ka     | -    | naa    | naki
| 3        | wangu   | waa    | ka   | -      | naa
| 4        | wirru   | wangu  | waa  | ka     | -
|====================================================

The main functions of derived valences are to either change the root
meaning of the verb or modify the number of arguments it takes. In both
cases, there is little regularity. The valence structure of verbs, and
their modified meanings, must be learned.

===== Common Verb Valences

For each of the seven verbs with irregular auxiliaries, the different
possible valences and according arguments are shown below. The default
valence appears in bold. The argument markers SUBJ and OBJ refer to the
subject and object respectively, which differs according to alignment.

* _ngurr_: *(2) SUBJ is OBJ*
* _gulwaj_: (2) SUBJ gives to OBJ; *(3) SUBJ gives COM to OBJ*
* _gurr_: (2) SUBJ has OBJ; *(3) SUBJ has OBJ in COM
manner*footnote:[For an example of the use of the comitative slot, see
the constituent negative in the syntax chapter.]
* _nnurr_: *(2) SENTENCE causes SENTENCE* footnote:[The verb _nnurr_
is a special case. See the subjunctive section.]
* _wann_: *(1) SUBJ knows*; (2) SUBJ knows OBJ; (3) SUBJ knows OBJ
because of INST
* _yurr_: *(1) SUBJ knows*; (2) SUBJ knows OBJ; (3) SUBJ knows OBJ
on the authority of COM
* _girr_: *(1) SUBJ senses something*; (2) SUBJ feels that
SENTENCE footnote:[Where the sentence is in the subjunctive mood.]

=== Modifiers

==== Adjectives

Adjectives are words used to describe or modify the meaning of a noun.
Adjectives in Ngujari perform only the _predicative function_: they
require a verb to function, and refer to the subject of the verb.

====
*birru-j nnijpa-pu* +
_ocean-nom calm-pred_ +
The sea is calm.
====

===== Cases

Noun case suffixes can in some cases be used to derive adjectives based
around that noun, as a lexical operation. The most common forms of case derivations are
orientative/revertive and instrumental.

Orientative and revertive suffiixs can be used to indicate the
"direction" of an adjective in relation to its noun. This distinction is
commonly found when talking about time.

====
age _jul_ +
⇒ new _jurni_ (orientative) +
⇒ old _julnga_ (revertive)

freshness _gurlu_ +
⇒ fresh _gurlurni_ +
⇒ stale _gurlunga_
====

===== Amplification

An adjective can be amplified in magnitude through reduplication. The
final syllable is duplicated, excluding its coda in the first instance.
If the final vowel is long following the derivation, it becomes
shortened.

====
big _yampu_ +
⇒ enormous _yampupu_

small _pangii_ +
⇒ tiny _pangiigi_

thick _yurlan_ +
⇒ fat _yurlarlan_
====

===== Relativisation

Many of Ngujari's adjectives are absolute rather than relative. For
example, _yampu_ ("big") refers to something bigger than a human, rather
than something big for its class (as in "the big elephant"). These
absolute adjectives can be converted to relative adjectives through the
suffix _pu_.

====
small (absolute) _pangii_ +
⇒ small (relative) _pangiipu_

warm (absolute) _mirra_ +
⇒ warm (relative) _mirrapu_
====

==== Quantifiers

A quantifier is used to specify the number of a noun. They can be
numerals, used for counting, or abstract amounts like "many".
Quantifiers are lexicalised as nouns in the nominative predicate clause.

===== Numerals

Ngujari uses a dual decimal-quinary counting system. The numerals are
based on increments of five or ten.

There are eleven basic numerals, spanning from zero to ten, outlined in
the table below.

.Numerals
[options="header"]
|==================================
| numeral | word | numeral | word
| 0       | nart |         |
| 1       | naju | 6       | nalwi
| 2       | guu  | 7       | puwa
| 3       | naa  | 8       | tuja
| 4       | jaru | 9       | jawu
| 5       | yi   | 10      | najuyi
|==================================

For numbers under ten, expression is simple. The speaker just uses the
corresponding numeral is used. But past ten, the numbers are expressed
as composites. Any numeral can be combined with the words _yi_ ("five")
or _najuyi_ ("ten") to multiply by that number. Composite numbers are
formed through multiples of five and ten combined with any extra
numerals, which follow the multiples. There are therefore two ways of
expressing any number, depending on the choice of five or ten as a base.

====
twelve +
_najuyi guu_ +
_guu-yi guu_

twenty-three +
_guu-najuyi naa_ +
_jaru-yi naa_ +
_najuyi guu-yi naa_


fifty +
_yi-najuyi_ +
_najuyi-yi_
====

When counting, a separate tally system may be used. "Marks", or chosen
multiples of five or ten, are expressed fully, but numbers in between
are expressed as the difference from the last mark.

====
*guu-najuyi naju guu naa jaru yi-yi naju...* +
twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six…
====

===== Abstract

Abstract quantifiers are subjective, unlike strict numerals. They are
used identically to concrete numbers.

Abstract quantifiers are a very small closed class, containing only six
words.

.Abstract quantifiers
|==================================
| jiingu  | some
| yuutii  | many
| gijta   | more than expected
| gigijta | many more than expected
| muungu  | less than expected
| mumungu | many less than expected
|==================================

=== Adverbs

An adverb is a word which modifies a clause.

_Manner_ adverbs modify the way the clause's verb is performed.

====
*k-a wa-j nna-l buutu ji wurr-u-m* +
_strike.AUX-PST 1s-NOM 3s-ACC hard 0.val.2 strike-AN-1st_ +
I struck him hard.
====

_Temporal_ adverbs modify when the clause occurs.

====
*k-aa wa-j nna-l ji wurr-u-m piitu* +
_strike.AUX-FUT 1s-NOM 3s-ACC 0.val.2 strike-AN-1st soon_ +
I will strike him soon.
====

The class of an adverb loosely determines its position in a phrase.
Adverbs are used as-is, and do not undergo derivation.
