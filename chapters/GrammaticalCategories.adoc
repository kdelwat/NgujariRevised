== Grammatical categories

=== Nouns

Nouns in Ngujari refer to concepts which exist regardless of time.
Whereas a verb may specify an action, a noun refers to a concrete or
abstract _object_.

Structurally, a noun has a number of important properties. It must
assume one of the four _genders_, which then lead to different verb conjugations.
Nouns themselves must be declined according to _case_ and _plurality_.

Nouns can be used as part of a sentence without any supporting
morphemes; they do not require articles or modifiers to assume meaning.

Distributionally, nouns are the head of noun phrases, which are used as
arguments to verbs or in verbless constructions like the adjectival
predicate.

Predominantly, nouns are used as part of a verb phrase. They are
distinguished from other word classes by their ability to assume the
role of subject in such verb phrases, whereas constructions like gerunds
cannot.

Nouns are an open class, and new morphemes are added or derived on a
sporadic but frequent basis.

==== Gender

Nominal gender is assigned semantically to nouns, based on their
meaning. While the form of a noun itself does not change based on
gender, the class has a number of important effects, including changing
morphosyntactic alignment, possessives selection, and verb conjugation.
These effects are discussed in greater detail later.

Ngujari has a dual-gender system. The major distinction is between the
animate and inanimate genders. The animate gender is assigned to people,
animals, spiritual locations, and many abstract concepts. For example,
_Yawirra_, the concept of the Land, is considered animate, as are
parts of the body with a sacred meaning. The inanimate gender applies to
all other nouns. The following table shows some examples of the
distinction.

.Some examples of gender
[options="header"]
|==========================================================
| animate                            | inanimate
| boy _wiingurki_                    | teacher _gajangu_
| warm-blooded animal _pawkii_       | living leaf _guwa_
| seal _niinga_                      | reed _kanaa_
| liver _ngunaju_                    | tongue _jaajannalu_
| breath _gajuwa_                    | food _nurtwu_
| bushfire _panwawa_                 | sunset _kii_
| a specific sacred site _Narriirna_ | rain _rrurta_
|==========================================================

The animate-inanimate distinction partially determines morphosyntactic
alignment. Consider the following example, in which two animate pronouns
are the subject and object of transitive phrase.

====
*nn-uma jana-j nna-l jinn-arruu-Ø* +
_eat.AUX-PST 1s.child-NOM 3s.adult-ACC eat-AN-1ST_ +
I (a child) ate it (an animate object).
====

The two animate pronouns cause the sentence to assume the
nominative-accusative alignment. If instead the object was inanimate,
the sentence would decline in the ergative-nominative alignment:

====
*nn-uma jana-Ø nnu-j jinn-arruu-Ø* +
_eat.AUX-PST 1s.child-ERG 3s.inan-NOM eat-AN-1ST_ +
I (a child) ate it (an inanimate object).
====

While this is the primary gender distinction, there is a secondary
subdivision. Within the animate there are three genders used only for
referring to humans, each representing a different stage of life: child,
adult, and Elder. These genders are important in determining pronouns
and verbal inflection.

Whereas animate/inanimate is a class defined once for a noun, the
child/adult/Elder gender is mutable, with a person assigned to one of
the genders based on social position. Those who are yet to undergo the
adulthood ceremony (under the age of roughly fourteen in the case of
females and sixteen in the case of males) are assigned the child gender,
while those who have become Elders of the mob receive the Elder gender.
All other ages are grouped into the adult gender.

The default gender in the stage distinction is adult. All non-human
animate nouns are treated as if they are members of the adult class for
purposes of verbal conjugation.

The following pair of examples demonstrates the role of the stage
distinction in verbal conjugation. The same sentence is conjugated for
both a group of children and a group of adults.

====
*k-aa juu-Ø kiru wiirr-uu-Ø yuurli-mu* +
_go.AUX-FUT 1pl.child-ERG where go-CHILD-1ST day-ORI_ +
Where will we (a group of children) go tomorrow?

*k-aa waya-Ø kiru wiirr-u-Ø yuurli-mu* +
_go.AUX-FUT 1pl.adult-ERG where go-ADULT-1ST day-ORI_ +
Where will we (a group of adults) go tomorrow?
====

The stage distinction is also used in declining predicate adjectives.

====
*nnarta-j pupa-tuu* +
_3s.child-NOM happy-CHILD_ +
The child is happy.

*Wiirrutii-j pupa-iiwa* +
_Wiirrutii-NOM happy-ELDER_ +
Wiirrutii (an elder) is happy.
====

==== Cases

Ngujari has eight nominal cases, with three indicating the
morphosyntactic alignment and five others. Cases are indicated by
single-syllable suffixes, as presented in the following table.

.Cases
[options="header"]
|=====================================
| case         | abbreviation | suffix
| ergative     | ERG          | -
| nominative   | NOM          | -j
| accusative   | ACC          | -l
| instrumental | INS          | -ma
| comitative   | COM          | -yi
| locative     | LOC          | -rn
| orientative  | ORI          | -rnu
| revertive    | REV          | -rna
|=====================================

For more details on the three alignment cases, see the alignment
chapter. The remaining five cases operate as follows.

===== Instrumental

The instrumental case (INS) is used when discussing a _means_, roughly
equivalent to the English "by means of" or "using". For example, when
speaking of killing a fish using a spear, a Ngujari speaker will place
"spear" in the instrumental case. The case can only be used with an
_inanimate_ noun.

====
*k-a nna-ø tirwa-j baalu-ma naa wuwiirr-u-m* +
_find.aux-pst 3s.an-erg route-nom map-ins 2.val.3 find-an-3rd_ +
He found the route using the map.
====

===== Comitative

The comitative case (COM) is equivalent to "in the presence of", or
"with", and specifies that the noun was present at the moment spoken of.
It often functions slightly differently in the context of certain verbs.
The case is used grammatically in the formation of the adjectival
predicative.

In the following example, the comitative is found in its standard sense.

====
*nn-uuki wiingurki-ø munnanna-rn bunna-yi winn-uu-mi* +
_jump.aux-fut boy-erg river-loc twin-com jump-an-3rd_ +
The boy, with his friend, will jump over the river.
====

Special meanings of the comitative arise when the verb has a dedicated comitative valence slot.

====
*j-a nnaa-ø parnti-j mungu-yi yanj-u-m* +
_steal.aux-pst 3pl.an-erg kangaroo.meat-nom woman-com steal-an-3rd_ +
They are stealing kangaroo meat from the woman.
====

===== Locative

The locative case (LOC) is used to specify a location, and can take the
place of a preposition such as "in" or "at". Many verbs of motion take
the locative as one of their prescribed arguments.

====
*k-aa wa-ø gaypa-rn wiirr-u-ø* +
_↗go.aux-fut 1s-erg mountain-loc go-an-1st_ +
Should I go to the mountain?
====

The cardinal directions are treated as if they have the locative case,
and hence do not use it where other nouns would.

===== Orientative and Revertive

The orientative case (ORI) is used to specify that something is facing
towards the noun. It is often used with the meaning of "heading
towards".

====
*j-i ku-ø tinyu-rnu yaj-u-n* +
_run.aux-pres 2s-erg camp-ori run-an-2nd_ +
You are running towards the camp.
====

The revertive case (REV) is used to specify that something is oriented
away from the noun. It can be used with the meaning of "heading away
from".

====
*k-i nnaa-j mulu-l ja-rna mirr-u-m* +
_bring.aux-pres 3pl.an-nom fish-acc 1d-rev bring-an-3rd_ +
They are bringing the fish away from us two.
====

It can also be used in asserting falsehood.

====
*j-arlu nna-ø pirraa-j naa baj-u-m* +
_look.aux-rem 3s.an-erg knowledge-nom 1.val.2 look-an-3rd_ +
He used to look away from knowledge / he used to be incorrect.
====

Both the orientative and revertive case can be used in place of the
locative place in any verbal argument slot that requires a locative,
allowing for finer control.

An example of the use of these cases is found in the following table,
which shows the declensions of the noun _naju_.

.Examples of case
[options="header"]
|=======================================================
| case         | word    | meaning
| ergative     | naju    |
| nominative   | najuj   |
| accusative   | najul   |
| instrumental | najuma  | "using the rock"
| comitative   | najuyi  | "in the presence of the rock"
| orientative  | najurnu | "oriented towards the rock"
| revertive    | najurna | "oriented away from the rock"
| locative     | najurn  | "at the rock"
|=======================================================

==== Plurality

Plurality refers to the number of a noun present. A singular noun has
only one of its kind present, while a plural noun has multiple. The
Ngujari language distinguishes between singular, plural, and dual (two
objects). By default, nouns are singular.

Plurals are formed through the process of reduplication footnote:[Repeating a part or whole of a word.], with the
un-declined noun repeated twice. The necessary case suffixes are then
applied to the end of the reduplicated form.

The process differs slightly depending on whether there is dual or
non-dual plurality. For non-dual, the entirety of the noun is simply
reduplicated. The same occurs for the dual, but the clitic _ka_ follows
the reduplicated noun before any adjectives.

Some examples of regular plurals can be found in the following table.

.Regular plurals
[options="header"]
|==========================================================
| meaning | singular | plural          | dual
| path    | wumpa    | wumpa-wumpa     | wumpa-wumpa-ka
| canoe   | turrayi  | turrayi-turrayi | turrayi-turrayi-ka
| berry   | murta    | murta-murta     | murta-murta-ka
| dingo   | nnalji   | nnalji-nnalji   | nnalji-nnalji-ka
|==========================================================

While the process of plural formation is usually regular, some animate
nouns have irregular plural forms, as below.

.Irregular plurals
[options="header"]
|==============================================================
| meaning      | singular     | plural       | dual
| woman        | mungu        | mungungu     | mungungu-ka
| man          | wiingu       | wiingungu    | wiingungu-ka
| girl         | mungurki     | mungurgu     | mungurguki
| boy          | wiingurki    | wiingurgu    | wiingurguki
| elder        | nguwa        | nguwii       | nguwii-ka
| sacred place | Yawirrannalu | Yawirrannala | Yawirrannala-ka
|==============================================================

In addition, some nouns are inherently both singular and plural and do
not adopt a special plural form. A handful of examples follows.

.More irregular plurals
[options="header"]
|========================
| meaning    | word
| food       | nurtwu
| flesh      | ngunna
| blood      | wirra
| rain cloud | rrurtawalu
| leaf       | nnaawi
|========================

There is no distinction between count nouns, which can be specifically
counted, and mass nouns, which cannot. The number of the noun present
can be specified through the usual adjective system.

====
rock _naju_ +
⇒ five rocks _yi naju_ +
⇒ a handful of rocks _ayi naju_
====

==== Proper nouns

Proper nouns are the names of specific objects, usually people. They are
most commonly found referring to members of the speaker's mob or
extended relationship network. However, many spiritual concepts in the
Dreamtime are referred to by proper nouns, which are capitalised for
clarity.

Proper nouns are structurally identical to regular nouns, except that
they lack the restriction on their final syllable and can end in a
consonant. In this instance, the usual suffixes are added to signify
case after reduplicating the final vowel in the noun.

====
*k-a girlipuu-girlipuu-ø Yurluj-urn naa yarr-a-m* +
_fall.aux-pst mango-pl-erg Yurluj-loc 1.val.2 fall-inan-3rd_ +
The mangoes fell on Yurluj.
====

However, proper nouns are unique in that they do not always require
inflection for grammatical case. Speakers will only decline proper nouns
if the sentence would be otherwise ambiguous. In the following sentence,
it is obvious that the proper noun takes the nominative position and it
is not inflected.

====
*j-aa munna-ø Parra naju-rna nakij-a-m* +
_move.aux-fut stream-erg Parra-nom rock-rev move-inan-3rd_ +
The stream will take Parra away from the rock.
====

The need to distinguish proper nouns using case inflections usually
arises when two proper nouns are in the same sentence.

====
*nn-i-yii Annurra-ø Najii-j yiinn-u-mi* +
_help.aux-pres-wimp Annurra-erg Najii-nom help-an-3rd_ +
Annurra should help Najii.
====

Even in circumstances where the meaning of the sentence would be
unambiguous without case inflection, the speaker may choose to inflect
if they are using a non-standard word order.

==== Pronouns

Pronouns behave almost exactly like nouns, with one exception:
indefinite and demonstrative pronouns do not decline for case.

===== Personal

Personal pronouns differ in three dimensions: person, plural, and
gender. All decline in the same way as regular nouns to indicate case.
The following tables list the pronouns:

.Child personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]
|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 1st person | jana     | janna | juu
| 2nd person | kurru    | kunii | kurlu
| 3rd person | nnarta   | nnaja | nni
|=======================================

.Adult personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]
|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 1st person | wa       | ja    | waya
| 2nd person | ku       | kuna  | kuu
| 3rd person | nna      | nnara | nnaa
|=======================================

.Inanimate personal pronouns
[cols="s,,,",options="header"]

|=======================================
|            | singular | dual  | plural
| 3rd person | nnu      | nnuka | nnunnu
|=======================================

When speaking of a mob's elders, a personal pronoun is never used. The
elder is always referred to by their honorific title.

===== Possessive

Possessive pronouns are formed through a suffix placed on the relevant
personal pronoun, but only for the child and adult genders. ForW
possession by elders, see *pronominal possession*. Inanimate objects
cannot be possessive. For a child, the suffix is _ra_ in first and
second person and _raa_ in third person. For an adult, the suffix is
_lu_ for all persons.

===== Interrogative

The interrogative pronouns are strongly affected by case, particularly
in the case of location and time. The basic pronouns are detailed in the
following table:

.Interrogative pronouns
[options="header"]
|====================
| meaning   | word
| where     | kiru
| when      | tuu
| who, what | pii
| how       | piima
| why       | wiirtak
| how many  | kirta
|====================

// TODO: cannot ask a question with just an interrogative pronoun like English. Instead have to say like "what (is it)?"

It is interesting to note that "how" is the same as "what" placed in the
instrumental case. The orientative and revertive cases can be applied to
_kiru_ ("where"), forming _kirurni_ ("whither/to where") and _kirunga_
("whence/from where"), as well as to _tuu_ ("when"), forming _tuurni_
("to when") and _tuunga_ ("from when").

===== Demonstrative

One set of demonstrative pronouns covers both proximal and distal
objects. Distinctions can be made in some cases between both gender and
number. The pronouns are found in the following table:

.Demonstrative pronouns
[options="header"]
|=================================================
| meaning          | singular | dual    | plural
| there            | naarla   | naarla  | naarla
| then             | yaji     | yaji    | yaji
| that (animate)   | yanna    | yannara | yannaa
| that (inanimate) | yannu    | yannuka | yannunnu
|=================================================

Again, the pronouns _naarla_ and _yaji_ can assume the orientative and
revertive cases.

===== Indefinite

The regular indefinite pronouns are formed through modifying the
interrogative pronouns by appending the correct word, representing
number. These words are listed in the following table:

.Indefinite pronouns
[options="header"]
|=================
| number   | word
| none     | nnayi
| singular | junga
| dual     | marri
| plural   | munaa
| all      | nnaya
|=================

For example, "everyone" would be expressed as _pii-nnaya_ and "some two
locations" as _kiru-marri_.

=== Verbs

A verb expresses an action or changing state.

Verbs in Ngujari are an open class, with infrequent additions to the
lexicon in the form of new or derived words.

Verbs can be split into three _classes_; each declining differently
but with no semantic meaning. Each class has a specific stem ending.
Verb roots lack a final consonant, meaning they must be conjugated in
order to appear in speech. The only effect of class is morphological.

In addition to its root lexeme, a verb is almost always accompanied by
an _auxiliary_: a separate word mandated by the verb's class which is
conjugated alongside the verb.

Each verb can be declined according to _person_ and _number_, marked
on the root, and _tense_ and _mood_, marked on the auxiliary. All
declensions are realised as agglutinative suffixes.

==== Class

The class of a verb is determined by its concluding phoneme. The three
classes occur in order of prevalence. A survey of all verb forms reveals
that the first and second classes account for more than 70% of all verbs
and a vast majority of the most frequently used, although otherwise
there is no difference in usage between the classes.

Class determines three aspects of usage:

* the particular suffixes of declension
* the form of the auxiliary particle
* the form of the negative particle

.Verb classes
[options="header"]
|================================================
| class  | ending | auxiliary | negative particle
| first  | -rr    | k-        | tu
| second | -j     | j-        | ti
| third  | -nn    | nn-       | wuu
|================================================

===== Irregular Auxiliaries

There are seven major verbs in Ngujari which have an irregular
auxiliary. Each auxiliary is a modified form of the base verb and must
be learned separately. Conjugation follows the verb's class and proceeds
as normal.

* _ngurr_: ngarr
* _gulwaj_: gulw
* _gurr_: garr
* _nnurr_: nnarr
* _wann_: wunn
* _yurr_: yirr
* _girr_: gurr

==== Dimensions

When declined as part of a sentence, the verb stem indicates the
_gender, person_, and _number_of an involved noun.

Person represents a perspective of the speaker: the relation they have
to the actor in the verb. If the speaker is performing the action, the
verb is in first person. If the speaker is directly addressing the
actor, it is in second person. And if the actor is someone else
entirely, the verb is in third person.

Number represents how many actors were involved. The verb may have been
performed by one actor, putting it in the singular number, two, putting
it in dual, or more than two, making it plural.

For transitive verbs and above, the agent of the clause determines these
dimensions.

====
*nn-uuki wa-ø wuwurna-j tinn-u-ø* +
_protect.AUX-FUT 1s-ERG coconuttree-NOM protect-an-1st_ +
I [an adult] will protect the coconut tree.

*nn-uuki nni-ø wuwurna-j tinn-arruu-mi* +
_protect.AUX-FUT 3pl.ch-ERG coconuttree-NOM protect-ch-3rd_ +
They [a group of children] will protect the coconut tree.

*nn-uuki wuwurna-ø nni-j tinn-aa-mi* +
_protext.aux-fut coconuttree-ERG 3pl-ch-NOM protect-inan-3rd_
====

For intransitive verbs, the subject determines the dimensions.

====
*wann-uu ku-j wann-u-ku* +
_know.AUX-PRES 2s-NOM know-AN-3rd_ +
You know.
====

|=================================================================================

==== Tense

Tense refers to the time at which the verb's action took place. There
are four marked tenses: remote past, past, present, and future.

Present is considered the default tense. It usually indicates those
events which are happening in the moment of utterance, but it can also
be used as a rudimentary form of a near-past tense, applying to actions
that were completed the same day as the utterance.

====
*j-i rrurtawalu-ø yuu-waya-rnu purki yaj-u-ø* +
_come.aux-pres rain.cloud-erg int-1pl-ori come-an-1st_ +
Are the rain clouds drawing near?

*gulw-i wa-j nnu-yi nna-l gulwaj-u-ø* +
_give.aux-pres 1s-nom 3s.inan-com 3s.an-acc give-an-1st_ +
I gave it to him earlier today.
====

The past tense simply refers to an event that began and concluded in the
past. If the event has not yet concluded, the present tense is used,
even if it began in the past.

====
*k-a waya-ø maaju-j bilj-u-m nna-j pirr-u-ø* +
_see.aux-pst 1pl-erg kangaroo-nom hop-an-3rd 3s.an-nom see-an-1st_ +
We saw the hopping kangaroo.
====

The remote past also indicates an event that was completed in the past.
The distinction between it and the standard past can be somewhat
arbitrary, but in general remote past is used in the following three
circumstances:

* recounting handed-down stories
* speaking of ancestral events
* referring to a habitual action that has concluded

====
*nn-una puu-ø Bilru-rn pupa-pu bunn-u-mi* +
_shine.aux-rem sun-erg bilru-loc happy-an shine-an-3rd_ +
The sun shone down on Bilru, who was happy.

*ngarr-arlu walma-ø gaypa-wa-rn ngurr-a-m* +
_be.aux-rem hut-erg mountain-loc be-inan-3rd_ +
The hut used to be on the hill.
====

The future tense refers to all events which are yet to take place,
regardless of how far in the future they occur.

====
*k-aa tu wa-ø naarla wiirr-u-ø* +
_go.aux-fut neg 1s-erg there go-an-1st_ +
I won't go there.
====

===== Aspect

Aspect refers to the definiteness of an action. The perfective aspect
refers to events which are complete and self-contained ("I ran"),
whereas the imperfective aspect refers to ongoing events ("I was
running"). In Ngujari, there is no morphological distinction drawn
between the perfective and imperfective aspects, meaning contextual
clues are vital for understanding.

====
*k-a wa-ø guumja-j pirr-u-ø, ngarr-a wa-ø gugannari-rn ngurr-u-ø* +
_see.aux-pst 1s-erg butterfly-nom see-an-1st, be.aux-pst 1s-erg forest-loc be-an-1st_ +
I was looking at a butterfly when I was in the forest.

*nnarr-i k-a wa-ø guumja-j pirr-u-ø k-i-tiru wa-j nartupurr-u-ø* +
_effect.aux-pres see.aux-pst 1s-erg butterfly-nom see-an-1st blush.aux-pres-sbjv 1s-nom blush-an-1st_ +
I saw a butterfly that made me blush.

==== Moods

A mood modifies the meaning of a verb. Verbs can be conjugated into one
of five moods:

* subjunctive
* weak imperative
* strong imperative
* gnomic
* dubitative

Mood is an optional part of verb formation. In a regular active
sentence, there is no mood.

====
*nn-i waya-j jinn-u-ø?* +
_↗ eat.aux-pres 1pl-nom eat-an-1st_ +
Should we eat?
====

But adding a mood, such as the imperative, changes the meaning of the
sentence.

====
*nn-i-yii waya-j jinn-u-ø* +
_eat.aux-pres-wimp 1pl-nom eat-an-1st_ +
Let's eat.

*nn-i-ju waya-j jinn-u-ø* +
_eat.aux-pres-strimp 1pl-nom eat-an-1st_ +
We must eat.
====

===== Subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is an _irrealis_ mood: it broadly signifies
abstractness, or that the speaker is unsure about the event in question.

The subjunctive is used in four places:

1.  Speculation
2.  Desires
3.  Conditional
4.  Purposive

The conditional and purposive cases are related to syntax, and are
discussed later.

The most common use of the subjunctive mood is speculation. If a speaker
is either unsure of an event's outcome, or does not know if it occurred
or will occur.

====
*k-a-tiru nna-ø maaju-j naa puwa tarr-u-m* +
_kill.AUX-PST-SUBJ 3s-ERG kangaroo-NOM 1.val.2 kill-AN-3RD_ +
He might have killed the kangaroo.

*j-a-tirlu nni-ø nnalu-rnu purki yaj-awuu-m, yirr-a yurr-a-ø* +
_walk.AUX-PST-SUBJ 3pl.ch-ERG place-ORI walk-CH-3rd, know.AUX-PRES know-AN-1st_ +
I think that they came back yesterday.
====

If the speaker is speaking hypothetically about a property of something
which is expressed as an adjective, the verb _ngurr_ must be used with a
predicate adjective rather than the verbless construction (discussed
later). _ngurr_ is in the subjunctive mood.

====
*ngarr-aa-tilu parra-ø kurlu-j tuwilwa-wa ka ngurr-a-m* +
_be.aux-fut-sbjv hunt-erg thing-NOM dangerous-in 2.val.1 be-inan-3rd_ +
The [prospective] hunt would be very dangerous.
====

The subjunctive is also used when expressing desires or dreams. The
desire must be first-hand; so recounting those of others does not use
the subjunctive.

====
*k-a-tiru wa-ø warlu-j jurni purr-a-ø* +
_want.AUX-PRES-SUBJ 1s-ERG bed-NOM new want-AN-1st_ +
I want a new bed.

*j-a nna-j wa-l ka naj-awu-m, "k-a wa-ø warlu-j jurni purr-a-ø"* +
_say.AUX-PST 3s-NOM 1s-ACC 3.val.2 say-AN-3rd, want.AUX-PRES 1s-ERG bed-NOM new want-AN-1st_ +
He said to me, "I want a new bed."
====

When desiring an action, the speaker uses a "wanting" verb, such as
_mann_, along with a verb phrase in the subjunctive expressing the
desired action. This action can be in any tense.

====
*nn-i wa-j j-a-tirlu ti nna-j ngarj-awu-m mann-u-ø* +
_wish.aux-prs 1s-nom hurt.aux-pst-sbjv neg 3s.an-nom hurt-an-3rd wish-an-1st_ +
I wish that he hadn't hurt himself.
====

===== Imperative

The imperative mood is used for suggestions and commands. The weak
imperative raises an idea or suggestion, without indicating an order,
similar to the English "let's go".

====
*nn-uuki-yii wuu waya-ø gunnari-j ka warnn-u-ø* +
_cut.AUX-FUT-WIMP neg 1pl-erg tree-nom 3.val.2 cut-an-1st_ +
Let's not cut down the tree.
====

The strong imperative signifies a command, such as "Leave!".

====
*nn-uuki-ju wuu ku-ø gunnari-j ka warnn-u-ku* +
_cut.AUX-FUT-WIMP neg 2s-erg tree-nom 3.val.2 cut-an-2nd_ +
Don't cut down the tree.
====

===== Gnomic

The gnomic mood states unequivocal facts or ideas. The statement must be
truly uncontentious to fit into the gnomic mood, a universal truth or
maxim.

====
*k-i-nga juunwi-juunwi-ø gayparnu narnn-u-m biintu-yi* +
_fly.aux-pres-gno bowerbird-PL-ERG east fly-an-3rd winter-adv_ +
Satin bowerbirds fly east for winter.
====

===== Dubitative

The dubitative mood indicates situational possibility. The speaker
acknowledges the possibility of an action but is unsure as to whether it
occurs. This is similar to English sentences using the auxiliary
"might".

====
*nn-aa-ti rrunn-u-mi* +
_rain.aux-fut-dub rain-an-3rd_ +
It might rain tomorrow.
====

===== Verbal Arguments

A verb's _valence_ determines the number of arguments it can take. For
example, a verb with a valence of two would take two nouns:

====
*k-a nnalji-ø pijtu-j nirr-u-m* +
_fight.AUX-PST dingo-ERG snake-NOM fight-AN-3RD_ +
The dingo fought the snake.
====

In addition to their valence, the arguments to verbs have restrictions
on their case. For the majority of transitive verbs, with a valence of
two, the arguments take the form of a subject and object. The cases are
determined by the alignment of the sentence.

However, this can differ, and some verbs have irregular argument cases.
This is especially true in the case of verbs relating to movement, which
instead take a subject and a location.

====
*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rn yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-loc run-an-1st_ +
I ran to the mountain [and ended up there].
====

When verbs take an argument in the locative case, the speaker can
instead use the revertive or orientative case for further control over
meaning.

====
*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rnu yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-ori run-an-1st_ +
I ran towards the mountain

*j-a wa-ø gaypa-rna yaj-awu-ø* +
_run.aux-pst 1s-erg mountain-rev run-an-1st_ +
I ran away from the mountain
====

===== Valence Modification

All verbs have a _default valence_: the number of arguments it takes
without modification. Most verbs are transitive, but valences can span
between avalent (taking no arguments) and quadrivalent (taking four).

However, many verbs are not restricted to their default valence, and can
take different numbers of arguments. These configurations cause the verb
to take on different meanings. A verb will have a minimum and maximum
valence, and cannot take on arguments outside of this range.

====
*j-i wa-j kuma-l wuj-u-ø* +
_hold.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc hold-an-1st_ +
I hold you

*j-i wa-j kuma-l wirra-yi naa wuj-u-ø* +
_hold.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc blood-com 2.val.3 hold-an-1st_ +
I love you (lit. I hold blood for you)
====

For a transitive verb, it is common to find a configuration with a third
argument in the comitative case, representing the means with which the
action occurred.

For example, the verb _wurr_ is by default avalent, taking no arguments.
In this case, it means "it is electrically storming". However, modifying
its valence to one changes its meaning to "to be struck by lightning",
and a valence of two allows it to mean "to strike". No other number of
arguments is allowed. Therefore, it has a minimum valence of zero and
maximum valence of two.

Valence modification occurs through special particles. These particles
typically immediately precede the modified verb, and indicate they take
an unusual number of arguments. A verb without a particle has default
valence.

|====================================================

The main functions of derived valences are to either change the root
meaning of the verb or modify the number of arguments it takes. In both
cases, there is little regularity. The valence structure of verbs, and
their modified meanings, must be learned.

===== Common Verb Valences

For each of the seven verbs with irregular auxiliaries, the different
possible valences and according arguments are shown below. The default
valence appears in bold. The argument markers SUBJ and OBJ refer to the
subject and object respectively, which differs according to alignment.

* _ngurr_: *(2) SUBJ is OBJ*
* _gulwaj_: (2) SUBJ gives to OBJ; *(3) SUBJ gives COM to OBJ*
* _gurr_: (2) SUBJ has OBJ; *(3) SUBJ has OBJ in COM

the constituent negative in the syntax chapter.]
* _nnurr_: *(2) SENTENCE causes SENTENCE* footnote:[The verb _nnurr_
is a special case. See the subjunctive section.]
* _wann_: *(1) SUBJ knows*; (2) SUBJ knows OBJ; (3) SUBJ knows OBJ

=== Modifiers

==== Adjectives

Adjectives are words used to describe or modify the meaning of a noun.
Adjectives in Ngujari perform only the _predicative function_: they
require a verb to function, and refer to the subject of the verb.

====
*birru-j nnijpa-pu* +
_ocean-nom calm-pred_ +
The sea is calm.
====

Before they can be used as predicates, adjectives must be inflected.
They are lexicalised as verbs, and agree with the gender of the
predicate phrase's subject.

To decline a predicate adjective, two steps are required:

1.  If the adjective ends in a vowel, its last consonant is added to the
end. Otherwise, it is unmodified.
2.  The relevant gender suffix of a class one verb is added as a suffix.

==== Quantifiers

A quantifier is used to specify the number of a noun. They can be
numerals, used for counting, or abstract amounts like "many".
Quantifiers are lexicalised as nouns in the nominative predicate clause.

===== Numerals

Ngujari uses a dual decimal-quinary counting system. The numerals are
based on increments of five or ten.

There are eleven basic numerals, spanning from zero to ten, outlined in
the table below.

.Numerals
[options="header"]
|==================================
| numeral | word | numeral | word
| 0       | nart |         |
| 1       | naju | 6       | nalwi
| 2       | guu  | 7       | puwa
| 3       | naa  | 8       | tuja
| 4       | jaru | 9       | jawu
| 5       | yi   | 10      | najuyi
|==================================

For numbers under ten, expression is simple. The speaker just uses the
corresponding numeral is used. But past ten, the numbers are expressed
as composites. Any numeral can be combined with the words _yi_ ("five")
or _najuyi_ ("ten") to multiply by that number. Composite numbers are
formed through multiples of five and ten combined with any extra
numerals, which follow the multiples. There are therefore two ways of
expressing any number, depending on the choice of five or ten as a base.

====
twelve +
_najuyi guu_ +
_guu-yi guu_

twenty-three +
_guu-najuyi naa_ +
_jaru-yi naa_ +
_najuyi guu-yi naa_


fifty +
_yi-najuyi_ +
_najuyi-yi_
====

When counting, a separate tally system may be used. "Marks", or chosen
multiples of five or ten, are expressed fully, but numbers in between
are expressed as the difference from the last mark.

====
*guu-najuyi naju guu naa jaru yi-yi naju...* +
twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six…
====

===== Abstract

Abstract quantifiers are subjective, unlike strict numerals. They are
used identically to concrete numbers.

Abstract quantifiers are a very small closed class, containing only six
words.

.Abstract quantifiers
|==================================
| jiingu  | some
| yuutii  | many
| gijta   | more than expected
| gigijta | many more than expected
| muungu  | less than expected
| mumungu | many less than expected
|==================================

=== Adverbs

An adverb is a word which modifies a clause.

_Manner_ adverbs modify the way the clause's verb is performed.

====
*k-a wa-j nna-l buutu ji wurr-u-m* +
_strike.AUX-PST 1s-NOM 3s-ACC hard 0.val.2 strike-AN-1st_ +
I struck him hard.
====

_Temporal_ adverbs modify when the clause occurs.

====
*k-aa wa-j nna-l ji wurr-u-m piitu* +
_strike.AUX-FUT 1s-NOM 3s-ACC 0.val.2 strike-AN-1st soon_ +
I will strike him soon.
====

The class of an adverb loosely determines its position in a phrase.
Adverbs are used as-is, and do not undergo derivation.
