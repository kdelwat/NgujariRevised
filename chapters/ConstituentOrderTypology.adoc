== Constituent order typology

=== Introduction

=== Constituent order in main clauses

Within a clause, nouns can take on one of multiple roles:

* The _agent_ of a transitive verb, which is a noun performing an action
on another noun.

====
*k-a wiingurki-ø taarirkiwa-j pirr-uu-m* +
_see.AUX-pst boy-erg stick-nom see-ch-3rd_ +
The boy saw the stick.
====

* The _patient_ of a transitive verb, or the noun that an action is
being performed on.

====
*k-a wiingurki-ø taarirkiwa-j pirr-uu-m* +
_see.AUX-pst boy-erg stick-nom see-ch-3rd_ +
The boy saw the stick.
====

* The _subject_ of an intransitive verb, which is a verb that only
requires one noun. For example, in the sentence "The dog barks", the dog
is the subject.

====
*nn-uu mungu-j wi rrunn-u-m* +
_cry.aux-pst woman-nom 0.val.1 cry-an-3rd_ +
The woman cries.
====

Inside a clause, Ngujari tends to be an APV/SV language. This means that
the agent and patient precede the verb in a transitive clause, and the
subject precedes the verb in an intransitive clause.

====
*wann-uma maaju-maaju-j ka jinn-u-m* +
_see.aux-pst kangaroo-pl-nom 2.val.1 eat-an-3rd_ +
The kangaroos ate/were eating.

*k-i wa-j kurru-l ji wurr-u-ø* +
_strike.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc 0.val.2 electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

When the valence of a clause's verb is greater than two, all extra
arguments come before the verb.

====
*nn-uu waya-ø tinyu-j panwa-yi naa tinn-u-ø* +
_protect.aux-pres 1pl-erg camp-nom fire-com 2.val.3 protect-an-1st_ +
We protect the camp with fire.
====

The presence of the verb at the end of the clause is fixed, but the
order of the nouns is flexible for pragmatic reasons. The speaker can
reverse agent and patient.

====
*k-i kurru-l wa-j ji wurr-u-ø* +
_strike.aux-pres 2s-acc 1s-nom 0.val.2 electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

The majority of the time, the agent will precede the patient. But if the
speaker is drawing attention to the patient, especially if the agent has
already been discussed and the patient is being introduced, it may move
to the position of importance before the agent.

=== Alignment

Ngujari has three alignment cases: ergative, nominative, and accusative.
The use of these cases and their corresponding suffixes allows for a
more free word order. Rather than the placement of words determining the
role of nouns in a sentence, the cases take on the role.

In a typical sentence, a noun can take on one of three roles:

*

The case assigned to each of these roles depends on the
_morphosyntactic alignment_, which is a set of rules for determining
each case. Ngujari is a _split ergative_ language, meaning that the
alignment changes depending on the nouns in use.

For clauses whose agent and object (or subject) are animate pronouns,
the alignment is _nominative-accusative_. In this alignment, the agent
and subject are assigned the nominative case and the object takes the
accusative case. The following example shows what this looks like in
practice.

====
*j-i wa-j nna-l miij-awu-ø* +
_love.aux-pres 1s-nom 3s-acc love-an-1st_ +
I love her.
====

All other clauses have an _ergative-nominative_ alignment, which means
that the object and subject are marked as nominative and the agent is
marked as ergative. The sentence above can be rewritten without using
the third-person pronoun, and will therefore be placed in the
ergative-nominative alignment.

====
*j-i wa-ø majuu-j miij-awu-ø* +
_love.aux-pres 1s-erg kangaroo-nom love-an-2nd_ +
I love the kangaroo.
====

=== Verb phrase

====
Verb Phrase: _vp = aux [neg] np(s) [adv(s)][val] v_ +
_VP = (NP) V'_ +
_V' = V' AdvP_ +
_V' = AdvP V'_ +
_V' = NP V'_ +
_V' = ValP V'_ +
_V' = T V_
====

A _verb phrase_ is the primary structure of a clause. The most basic
clause possible is an avalent footnote:[An avalent verb is one that takes
no nouns or arguments.] verb. This is demonstrated in the following
example:

====
*nn-uu rrunn-aa* +
_rain.aux-pres rain-inan-1st_ +
It's raining.
====

image:images/nnuu-rrunnaa.png[]

In practice, most verb phrases will involve nouns. While word order is
flexible, as previously described, there are three rules which generally
apply:

1.  The verb's auxiliary appears at the beginning of the phrase.
2.  The verb itself appears at the end.
3.  Valence modifiers appear immediately before the verb.

====
*k-a nna-ø mulwi-j nnaa-rnu mirr-u-m* +
_bring.aux-pst 3s-erg bread-nom 3pl-ori bring-an-3rd_ +
He brought the bread to them.
====

// TODO: these are wrong - can't generate T in V'
image:images/he-brought-bread.png[]

====
*k-i panwa-ø wi yirr-a-m* +
_burn.aux-pres fire-erg 0.val.1 burn-inan-3rd_ +
The fire burns.
====

image:images/the-fire-burns.png[]

However, for pragmatic reasons the speaker may move the verb's auxiliary
from its regular position at the beginning of the clause to after the
verb's arguments. It must appear _after_ any valence modifiers to avoid
violating the verb phrase rules.

====
*kurru-l wa-j ji k-i wurr-u-ø* +
_2s-acc 1s-nom 0.val.2 strike.aux-pres electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.

*wa-j kurru-l ji k-i wurr-u-ø* +
_1s-nom 2s-acc 0.val.2 strike.aux-pres electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

image:images/I-strike-you.png[]

=== Noun phrase

====
_NP = N'_ +
_N' = N (CP)_
====

A verb phrase can take more than just bare nouns. A _noun phrase_ is a
constituent which acts like a noun. It can contain the noun alone, but
can also be modified by a relative clause.

The relative clause always appears at the end of the noun phrase

====
*birru-ø* +
_sea-erg_ +
sea
====

image:images/birru.png[]

====
*kanaama yirlirna-j gu* +
_woven basket-nom small_ +
small woven basket
====

==== Relative Clauses

Relative Clause: _rc = [aux][neg] v [val][adv(s)] np(s)_

A relative clause is a clause which modifies a noun (the _head noun_).
Ngujari uses _adjoined_ relative clauses, which means that the relative
clause is simply appended to the end of the verb. However, it must first
be placed into a slightly different form than a standard clause.

There are two cases for a relative clause:

* _object clauses_, in which the head noun is the object of the
relative clause.
* _agent clause_, where the head noun is the relative clause's agent
or subject.

In both types of relative clause, the verb is moved from the end of the
clause to a position immediately following the verb's auxiliary.

In an object clause, the valency of the verb is reduced by one. In
effect, the head noun becomes a noun in the clause.

====
*wiingu-ø k-a pirr-u-ø ka wa-j* +
_man-erg aux-pst see-an-1st 2.val.1 1s-nom_ +
the man that I saw
====

In an agent clause, the valency is not modified. Instead, a pronoun that
matches the person, plurality, and animacy of the head noun is added to
the relative clause.

====
*j-a Wuurna-ø nn-uuki-ti yann-u-mi nna-j jurlu-l wa-j ka naj-u-m* +
_say.aux-pst Wuurna-erg aux-fut-dub catch-an-3rd 3s-nom turtle-acc 1s-nom 3.val.2 say-an-3rd_ +
Wuurna, who might catch a turtle, spoke to me.
====

=== Adpositional phrases

=== Comparatives

A comparative is a sentence which compares one noun to another, using an
adjective. Ngujari uses _locational-type comparatives_ which are
verbless. The noun to be judged against (the _standard noun_) is given
a locational case, while the noun that is being judged is given the case
that it would assume as the subject of an intransitive verb. The two
nouns are then followed by the adjective, which is in the predicate form
(see *morphology*).

If the judged noun is 'more' of the adjective than the standard noun,
the revertive case is used. If they are the same, the locative case is
used.

====
*nna-j wa-rna yam-u* +
_3s-nom 1s-rev tall-an_ +
He is taller than me.

*gungaa-ø muyu-rn yurli-la* +
_axe-erg spear-loc dull-inan_ +
The axe and spear are equally as dull.
====

Comparatives may be used in relative clauses. The adjective becomes the
first word in the clause and is followed by the nouns. One of the nouns
is replaced by a pronoun as usual.

====
*k-a nnalji-ø junn-u nna-ø wiinguurki-rna yuki-j ka giirr-u-m* +
_win.aux-pst dingo-erg fast-an 3s-erg boy-rev race-nom 2.val.1 win-an-3rd_ +
The dingo, who is faster than the boy, won the race.
====

=== Question particles and question words

=== Modifier Positioning

==== Adjectives

// TODO

==== Adverbs

Adverbs can be split into two categories:

* Temporal adverbs specify the time a verb takes place
* Manner adverbs detail the manner in which the verb was conducted

Temporal adverbs usually follow the base verb.

====
*k-a jana-ø jari-rn wiirr-uu-ø yuurli-rna ma* +
_go.aux-pst 1s.ch-erg beach-loc go-ch-1st day-rev one_ +
Yesterday, I [a child] went to the beach.
====

Manner adverbs usually precede the base verb.

====
*nn-uuki-yii waya-ø pirwa-pirwa-j garrna gann-u-ø* +
_pickup.aux-fut-wimp 1pl-erg clothing-pl-nom quickly pickup-an-1st_ +
We should pick up the clothes quickly.
====

However, both can occupy different positions inside the verb phrase if
the speaker desires it.

=== Predicates

A _predicate_ is a sentence which modifies a noun. There are three
types:

* _Adjectival_, in which a noun is modified by an adjective, such as
"The grass is green".
* _Nominal_, where the noun is modified by another noun. This is
commonly used for professions, as in "She is a teacher".
* _Locational_, which assigns a location to a noun, such as "The
campsite is in the valley".

The Ngujari language distinguishes between these types and forms each in
a different way.

==== Adjectival

Adjectival Predicate: _apred = n [adj(s)-pred/n-com]_

An adjectival predicate is formed without the use of a verb, and simply
requires a noun and at least one adjective. The noun is first given the
same case as if it were a subject footnote:[The subject is the only
argument to an intransitive verb.].

Any adjectives are changed to their predicate form (see *morphology*).
The adjectives then simply follow the noun.

====
*puurna-j birruku-ku* +
_sky-nom blue-an_ +
The sky is blue.
====

There is another form of adjectival predicate, in which a noun is used
in place of an adjective. While this may seem counterintuitive, the noun
in effect becomes an adjective. This form is used when describing a
changeable state. The described noun is treated as above, but the
modifying noun is given the comitative case.

====
*murta-j gurlu-yi* +
_berry-nom freshness-com_ +
The berry is fresh.
====

==== Nominal

Nominal Predicate: _npred = be.aux n-subj n-obj be_

A nominal predicate is formed using _ngurr_, the verb for "to be". By
default, _ngurr_ has a valence of two, taking an agent and an object.
The described noun is the agent and the modifying noun is the object.

====
*ngarr-i wa-ø gajangu-j ngurr-u-ø* +
_be.aux-pres 1s-erg teacher-nom be-an-1st_ +
I am a teacher.
====

The nominal predicate is also used for quantifiers. The quantifier takes
the place of the noun, but does not assume the object case marker.

====
*ngarr-aa mungu-ø yuutii ngurr-u-m* +
_↗ be.aux-fut woman-erg many be-an-3rd_ +
Will there be many women?
====

When determining the alignment of a sentence, a quantifier is treated as
an animate pronoun. In a transitive verb, this means that an animate
pronoun in the subject position will take the nominative case.

====
*ngarr-i waya-j jaru ngurr-u-ø* +
_be.aux-pres 1pl-nom four be-an-1st_ +
There are four of us.
====

The noun being modified must be in its singular form.

==== Locational

Locational Predicate: _lpred = be.aux n-subj n-loc be_

A locational predicate is formed in almost the same way as a nominal
predicate. The only difference is that the modifying location is given
the locative case, rather than the comitative.

====
*k-i wurlki-ø kirujunga-ø ngurr-a-m* +
_be.aux-pres village-erg somewhere-loc be-inan-3rd_ +
The village is somewhere.
====

=== Possession

There are three types of possession in the Ngujari language.

The first two are distinguished by their changeability. _Alienable
possession_ isn't permanent, and is subject to change, whereas
_inalienable possession _cannot be changed. The difference between the
two revolves around culture, and is outlined in *possession*.

The third type is _group possession_, in which something is owned by
the tribe as a whole. This is formed in a different way to the first
two.

==== Alienable

Alienable possession is either _locative-based_ or _pronominal_.

In locative-based possession, the verb _ngurr_ is used. The possessed
noun becomes the agent of the verb, while the possessor is given the
locative case. Unusually, this means that the verb does not have a noun
in the object case, even though its valence remains the same.

Locative-based possession can be thought of as a noun being on
somebody's person. Where in English we might say "I have a spear", the
literal Ngujari translation is closer to "The spear is on me", even if
the spear is in fact kilometres away. This can be seen in the following
example.

====
*ngarr-i mulu-mulu-ka-ø mungu-rn ngurr-a-m* +
_be.aux-pres deadfish-pl-dual-erg woman-loc be-inan-3rd_ +
The woman has two dead fish.
====

The second form of the alienable possession, pronominal possession, is
formed through the use of a possessive pronoun. The pronoun is used in
the same way as an adjective, appearing after the possessed noun.

====
*nn-uma nnaa-ø waju-j yurni nna-lu giinn-u-m* +
_admire.aux-pst 3pl.an-erg face-nom beautiful 3s.an-pos admire-an-3rd_ +
They admired his beautiful face.
====

==== Inalienable

Inalienable possession is indicated through the use of the verb
_gurr_. The possessor becomes the agent and the possessed noun becomes
the object.

====
*garr-aa-nga ngungu-ø jarta-j ka gurr-u-ø* +
_have.aux-fut-gno mob-erg homeland-nom 3.val.2 have-an-1st_ +
Our mob will always have a homeland.
====

It is important to note that _gurr_ is by default trivalent, meaning it
takes three nouns: an agent, an object, and a _manner_. The manner is
a noun in the comitative case, and describes the means by which the noun
became or is possessed. The following example is the same as the above,
except a manner is specified.

====
*garr-aa-nga ngungu-ø jarta-j yuurrpa-yi ka gurr-u-ø* +
_have.aux-fut-gno mob-erg homeland-nom courage-com 3.val.2 have-an-1st_ +
Our mob will always have a homeland, due to our courage.
====

==== Group

In Ngujari culture, an object can be owned by a mob as a whole. With the
exception of areas of land, only inanimate nouns may be possessed by a
mob.

Group possession is formed using the special particle _tuu_, which
appears before the noun. To specify the possessing mob, the mob's name
is placed immediately after the particle.

====
*nn-i-ju waya-ø tuu-Gurnu jaku nnalu-j muu-ma naa tinn-u-ø* +
_protect.aux-strimp 1pl-erg pos-gurnu precious land-nom spirit-inst 2.val.3 protect-an-1st_ +
We must protect our [the Gurnu mob's] precious land with vigour.
====

The regular name is used by members of the possessing mob, but the
honorific name is used for possessions of others footnote:[Culture
dictates that each mob has two names: an "insider" name and an
"outsider" name. To use the insider name without being a member of the
mob is a grave offence.]. For example, the combined particle for
something owned by the Wujanga mob would be _tuu-Wujanga_ for a member
or _tuu-Wujarra_ for an outsider.

=== Interrogative

_Interrogatives_ are simply questions. There are two types of
interrogatives:

* _Polar_, which have an affirmative or negative answer.
* _Non-polar_, which require a more detailed response.

==== Polar

Polar questions are extremely easy to form. They are expressed as a
factual statement, but with a rising tone at the beginning of the
question.

====
*nn-uuki kupa-kupa-ø gaypa-gaypa-rn narnn-u-m?* +
_↗ fly.aux-fut bird-pl-erg mountain-pl-loc fly-an-3rd_ +
Will the birds fly to the mountains?
====

==== Non-Polar

The primary way of forming a non-polar question is through the use of
interrogative pronouns (such as _piima_). The interrogative takes the
place of a noun in a verb phrase, but is not assigned a case.

====
*k-a pii munnanna-rn wa-yi naa wiirr-u-m* +
_go.aux-pst who river-loc 1s.an-com 2.val.3 go-an-3rd_ +
Who went to the river with me?
====

This method of questioning can be used in any type of sentence, not just
basic clauses. The following example shows its use in a locational
predicate which contains a relative clause. The interrogative pronoun,
_kiru_, is moved to the front of the sentence to highlight its
importance.

====
*kiru ngarr-i wumpa-ø j-i palyaj-a-m nnu-ø wurlki-j ngurr-a-m* +
_where be.aux-pres path-erg leadto.aux-prs leadto-inan-3rd 3s.inan-erg village-nom be-inan-3rd_ +
Where is the path that leads to the village?
====

A less-common way to ask a non-polar question requires the particle
_yuu_. By placing the particle ahead of a word in a statement, the
speaker questions that word.

====
*k-aa yuu-nnara-ø nurtwu-j panwa-rnu mirr-uu-m* +
_bring.aux-fut int-3dual.an-erg food-nom fire-ori bring-ch-3rd_ +
Will it be those two children who bring the food to the fire?

*nn-i wa-ø yuu-gurlurni parnti-j jinn-u-mi* +
_eat.aux-pres 3s-erg int-fresh kangaroomeat-nom eat-an-3rd_ +
Is the kangaroo meat he is eating fresh?
====

=== Conditional

A conditional places a condition on another statement. They are formed
through two verb phrases, one representing the condition (or protasis)
and the other representing the outcome (or apodosis). There are two
types of conditional:

* _implicative_, where the conditional represents a universal truth.
Whenever the condition is true, the outcome is also true. It is
important to remember that the implicative form is always true. A
statement such as "When the wind blows, the leaves rustle" meets this
criteria, whereas "If you go there, you'll be attacked" does not.
* _predictive_, where the conditional represents a prediction. This is
the more general form, and can be used without worrying about universal
truth.

To form both conditionals, the condition verb phrase appears first,
followed immediately by the outcome verb phrase. No connector is
necessary between the two clauses (i.e. there is no equivalent to "if").
The outcome phrase is always placed in the subjunctive mood and present
tense.

In an implicative conditional, the condition is given the gnomic mood
and the present tense. The statement must therefore follow the usual
rules of the gnomic, in that it must state an indisputable truth.

====
*k-i-nga kunii-ø mu-rn naa yarr-uu-n j-i-tirlu kunii-j ka mulj-awuu-n* +
_fall.aux-prs-gno 2dual.ch-erg water-loc 1.val.2 fall-ch-2nd wet.aux-prs-sbjv 2dual-ch-nom 2.val.1 wet-ch-2nd_ +
If you two fall in the water, you will both get wet.
====

In a predictive conditional, the condition is usually not given a mood,
but can assume any tense.

====
*nn-uuki palwuuwa-j ka girnn-aa-mi k-i yannu-ø nna-j ji wurr-a-rn* +
_ break.aux-fut branch-nom 2.val.1 break-inan-3rd strike.aux-pres dem.sg.inan-erg 3s-an-nom 0.val.2 strike-inan-3rd_ +
If that branch breaks, it will strike him.
====

There is one exception to this rule. If the condition is seen as
unlikely, the phrase is a _counterfactual_. In this case, the
condition is given the dubitative mood. Usually, the condition will then
be in the future tense.

====
*k-aa-tila nna-ø maaju-j yirn parr-u-m ngarr-tiru nurtwa-nurtwa-rn yuni waya-j ngurr-a-m* +
_hunt.aux-fut-dub 3s.an-erg kangaroo-nom completedly hunt-an-3rd be.aux-subj food-pl-loc lots 1pl-nom be-inan-3rd_ +
If he were to successfully hunt the kangaroo [unlikely], we would have lots of food.
====

=== Negative

A negative simply inverts the meaning of a part of a sentence.

Clausual negation is expressed through both analytic and morphological markings.

To form the clausal negative, the negative particle must be
used footnote:[The negative particle corresponds to the class of the
clause's verb. See the morphology chapter for more.].

In a standard negative clause, the particle follows the auxiliary of the
verb.

====
_go.aux neg 3s.an-erg there go-an-3rd_ +
He doesn't go there.
====

However, the mood of the negative sentence must be subjunctive, if in any
non-present tense.

// TODO: add example

However, in an imperative clause (one that uses the weak or strong imperative
mood, see *tense and mood*), the particle is instead placed before the
auxiliary, and the subjunctive is not used.

// TODO: add example

There are two negative particles; one for predicate nominals (all classes), the
other for all other sentences (_tuu_).

In all clausal negatives, _qualifiers_ can be used as stand-alone
utterances, which follow the sentence. A qualifier is a word such as
_wulnni_ ("never") which modifies the negative.

====
*ti j-i-yuu ku-j waa yanj-awu-n wulnni* +
_neg steal.aux-strimp 2s-nom 3.val.1 steal-an-2nd never_ +
You must never steal.
====

==== Derivational negation

An adjective can be negated through a prefix. If the adjective begins
with a stop, the prefix is _wuu_. Otherwise, it is _tu_.

====
long (distance) _yungi_ +
⇒ short (distance) _tuyungi_

heavy (rain) _ganu_ +
⇒ light (rain) _wuuganu_
====

=== Reflexive/Reciprocal

// In reflexive clauses, the personal pronoun of the subject simply
// occupies the object position in the usual case. However, the valence of
// the verb must be decreased by one.
//
// ====
// *k-i Paya-ø nna-j ka tiirr-u-m* +
// _carefor.aux-prs paya-erg 3s.an-nom 2.val.1 carefor-an-3rd_ +
// Paya cares for himself.
// ====
//
// If the clause is reciprocal, which applies only to plural subjects, the
// personal pronoun is still used except it takes the comitative case. The
// valence is also still decreased by one.
//
// ====
// *k-arlu kuu-j kuu-yi ka pirr-u-n* +
// _see.aux-rem 2pl-nom 2pl-com 2.val.1 see-an-2nd_ +
// You [plural] used to see each other.
// ====

Ngujari uses a dual analytic/morphological system for reflexives and
reciprocals, which are the same construction.

The personal pronoun of the subject occupies the object position and is
correctly declined, while the auxiliary is marked with the reflex/reciprocal
suffix _naki_ (TODO: add).

====
_carefor.AUX-PRES-REFL Paya-NOM 3S.AN-ACC carefor-AN-3RD_ +
Paya cares for himself.
====

In reflexive constructions, the personal noun is considered to be a pronoun. As
such, the clause is in the nominative-accusative alignment.

The reflexive can be used only for animate subjects. In addition, reciprocals
can further take only plural subjects.

====
_see.AUX-REM-REFL 2PL-NOM see-AN-2ND_ +
You (pl) used to see each other.
====

If the subject of the clause is itself a personal pronoun, the object is
dropped. Hence the reflexive is not necessarily a valence-decreasing operation.

===== Morphological reflexives in possession

When the subject of a VP is the possessor of an object or oblique in the phrase,
the possessed is marked with the reflexive suffix.

====
_3S.AN-ERG ball-ABS-REFL kick-AN-1ST_ +
He kicked his ball.

*maybe*
_ball-ABS-REFL kick-AN-1ST_ +
He kicked his ball.
====

==== Lexical reflexives

If a verb is reflexive by default, the verb will be intransitive and used as
normal, rather than through the analytic/morphological process described above.

// TODO: insert table of examples

=== Antipassive

The antipassive is a valence-decreasing operation. When the patient of a
transitive phrase is to be downplayed, it is omitted. The agent assumes the
absolutive case (usually), or nominative case (with animate pronoun). The verb
is marked with the intransitive modifier _waa_ (TODO: add), as a suffix.

====
_attack.AUX-PST dog-ERG 3S.AN-ABS attack-AN-3RD_ +
The dog attacked him.

_attack.AUX-PST dog-ABS attack-INTRANS-AN-3RD_ +
c.f. The dog attacked (him).
====

// TODO: show example of antipassive used to push RC to adjoined relative clause
// e.g. The dog, [who was attacking]antipassive, barked

=== Nominalisation

A verb is nominalised by adding its final vowel and a relevant suffix.

==== Action nominalisation

Occurs when a verb is nominalised to a noun representing its action.

The nominalisation is usually morphological but in some exceptions is lexical.

The gerund of a verb serves two purposes. It can act in a way similar to
the English gerund, where the verb is used as a noun, or in a way
similar to an infinitive, meaning roughly "in order to".

The gerund is formed through nominalising the verb. The last vowel of
the verb is simply appended as a suffix.

When used in the nominal form, the gerund takes the appropriate noun
case.

====
*k-arlu wa-j junnu yuurr-u-ø* +
_like.aux-rem 1s-nom swim.ger like-an-1st_ +
I used to like swimming.
====

// maybe not, check clauses
// In the infinitive form, the gerund is placed before the verb's
// auxiliary.
//
// ====
// *parra k-a nni-j naarla wiirr-u-m* +
// _hunt.ger go.aux-pst 3s.an-nom there go-an-3rd_ +
// He went there to hunt.
// ====

==== Participant nominalisation

Ngujari supports agent nominalisation, in which the verb is nominalised to refer
to its agne.t This is an almost completely productive operation.

// TODO: add exceptions

The suffix _ngu_ (person) is added to nominalise the verb.

Instrument nominalisation is a syntactic process, that uses the demonstrative
pronoun as a clause's agent.

====
_DEMPRON-INAN-ERG coffee.ABS grind-INAN-3RD_ +
coffee grinder (lit. "that which grinds coffee")
====

// TODO: example of usage in a sentence

The verb must be in the present tense.

Locational nominalisation uses the suffix _nnalu_ (ground). A nominalised
location implicitly takes locative case, and is not marked if it does so. It can
be marked for revertive or orientative, but can take no other cases.

// TODO: change example in next line, it's from Describing Morphosyntax
In an agent nominalisation, there is no distinction between "classes" (e.g.
teacher) and "events" (e.g. the person currently teaching.)

=== Causatives

There are two forms of the causative. The _nominative causative_ occurs for
direct causation when a single noun is responsible for causing a verb phrase to
occur. However, if an entire verb phrase is responsible, or the causation is
more indirect, clause chaining is used.

==== Nominative causative

When a noun phrase is responsible for the action taking place, the nominal
causative is used.

The operation occurs morphologically. The auxiliary of the verb phrase receives
the causative suffix _ji_ (TODO: add). The causee receives the comitative case,
and causer the agentive.

In both transitive and intransitive clauses, the verb phrase agrees with the
causer.

====
intrans +
_capsize.AUX-PST-CAUS canoe-COM 3S.AN-NOM capsize-AN-3RD_ +
He caused the canoe to capsize.

trans +
_drop.AUX-PST-CAUS 1S-COM axe-ABS my wind-ERG drop-INAN-3RD_ +
The wind made me drop my axe.
====

// In the nominative causative, an extra argument is added to the verb
// phrase without modifying the valence. The argument is the causer, and
// takes the former subject's form (be it nominative or ergative). The
// causee, or the argument which was formerly the subject, then takes the
// comitative case instead. The verb remains in agreement with the former
// subject.

// ====
// *j-a turrayi-j mu nnij-a-m* +
// _capsize.aux-pst canoe-nom capsize-inan-3rd_ +
// The canoe capsized.
//
// *j-a turrayi-yi nna-j mu nnij-a-m* +
// _capsize.aux-pst canoe-com 3s.an-nom capsize-inan-3rd_ +
// He caused the canoe to capsize.
//
// *k-a wa-ø wuta-j walu gukarr-u-ø* +
// _drop.aux-pst 1s-erg axe-nom my drop-an-1st_ +
// I dropped my axe.
//
// *k-a wa-yi wuta-j walu gaju-ø gukarr-u-ø* +
// _drop.aux-pst 1s-com axe-nom my wind-erg drop-an-1st_ +
// The wind caused me to drop my axe.
// ====

// TODO: probably delete
// ==== Subjunctive Purposive
//
// The subjunctive purposive is formed through the use of the verb
// _nnurr_. The auxiliary, _nnarr_ takes the present tense, and begins
// the sentence. The verb itself is not required, but it still takes two
// verb phrases as arguments. The verb phrase causing the other assumes its
// usual tense and mood, but the caused action becomes present and
// subjunctive.
//
// ====
// *nnarr-i k-a nna-ø naarla wiirr-u-m j-i-tirlu wa-j nna-l nnurr-u-ø* +
// _effect.aux-prs go.aux-pst 3s.an-erg there go-an-3rd follow.aux-prs-sbjv
// 1s-nom 3s-an-acc follow-an-1st_ +
// He went there, so I followed him.
// ====

=== Participant Reference

Verbs reference subject person and number through suffixes.

There are two situations in which participant reference is anaphoric (and the
verb can stand alone without a noun phrase subject).

1. Intransitive clauses where the reference has been preestablished.

====
_... ? cry-AN-3RD_ +
What does the monkey do? It cries.
====

Or where the subject is an animate pronoun.

====
_cry-AN-3RD_ +
He cries.
====

2. In the main clause of a clause chain, where the subject is an animate pronoun
and the only explicit argument to the final verb.

// TODO: see "car arrives" example

In other cases, participant reference is purely grammatical and the agreeing
noun phrase must be present.

=== Focus, contrast, topicalisation

Topicalisation is the process of fronting a noun phrase for emphasis, indicating
the topic of the sentence. Topicalisation occurs through left-dislocation:  the
noun phrase elevated is moved to the front of the sentence, seperated with a
pause, before the sentence runs as usual but with a pronoun (personal?)
corefering back to the dislocated noun phrase. The fronted noun is marked for
case, but the corefering pronoun is not.

====
_[kangaroo-ABS]i kill.AUX-PST 1S-ERG [3S-INAN]i kill-AN-1ST_ +
As for the kangaroo, I killed it.
====

Topicalisation is permitted only for noun phrases that are not the subject.
