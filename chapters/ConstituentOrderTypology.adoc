== Constituent order typology

=== Introduction

=== Constituent order in main clauses

Within a clause, nouns can take on one of multiple roles:

* The _agent_ of a transitive verb, which is a noun performing an action
on another noun.

====
*k-a wiingurki-ø taarirkiwa-j pirr-uu-m* +
_see.AUX-pst boy-erg stick-nom see-ch-3rd_ +
The boy saw the stick.
====

* The _patient_ of a transitive verb, or the noun that an action is
being performed on.

====
*k-a wiingurki-ø taarirkiwa-j pirr-uu-m* +
_see.AUX-pst boy-erg stick-nom see-ch-3rd_ +
The boy saw the stick.
====

* The _subject_ of an intransitive verb, which is a verb that only
requires one noun. For example, in the sentence "The dog barks", the dog
is the subject.

====
*nn-uu mungu-j wi rrunn-u-m* +
_cry.aux-pst woman-nom 0.val.1 cry-an-3rd_ +
The woman cries.
====

Inside a clause, Ngujari tends to be an APV/SV language. This means that
the agent and patient precede the verb in a transitive clause, and the
subject precedes the verb in an intransitive clause.

====
*wann-uma maaju-maaju-j ka jinn-u-m* +
_see.aux-pst kangaroo-pl-nom 2.val.1 eat-an-3rd_ +
The kangaroos ate/were eating.

*k-i wa-j kurru-l ji wurr-u-ø* +
_strike.aux-pres 1s-nom 2s-acc 0.val.2 electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

When the valence of a clause's verb is greater than two, all extra
arguments come before the verb.

====
*nn-uu waya-ø tinyu-j panwa-yi naa tinn-u-ø* +
_protect.aux-pres 1pl-erg camp-nom fire-com 2.val.3 protect-an-1st_ +
We protect the camp with fire.
====

The presence of the verb at the end of the clause is fixed, but the
order of the nouns is flexible for pragmatic reasons. The speaker can
reverse agent and patient.

====
*k-i kurru-l wa-j ji wurr-u-ø* +
_strike.aux-pres 2s-acc 1s-nom 0.val.2 electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

The majority of the time, the agent will precede the patient. But if the
speaker is drawing attention to the patient, especially if the agent has
already been discussed and the patient is being introduced, it may move
to the position of importance before the agent.

=== Verb phrase

====
Verb Phrase: _vp = aux [neg] np(s) [adv(s)][val] v_ +
_VP = (NP) V'_ +
_V' = V' AdvP_ +
_V' = AdvP V'_ +
_V' = NP V'_ +
_V' = ValP V'_ +
_V' = T V_
====

A _verb phrase_ is the primary structure of a clause. The most basic
clause possible is an avalent footnote:[An avalent verb is one that takes
no nouns or arguments.] verb. This is demonstrated in the following
example:

====
*nn-uu rrunn-aa* +
_rain.aux-pres rain-inan-1st_ +
It's raining.
====

In practice, most verb phrases will involve nouns. While word order is
flexible, as previously described, there are three rules which generally
apply:

1.  The verb's auxiliary appears at the beginning of the phrase (except if the verb is in the present tense, and the auxiliary would otherwise be unmodified, in which case it may be omitted)
2.  The verb itself appears at the end.
3.  Valence modifiers appear immediately before the verb.

====
*k-a nna-ø mulwi-j nnaa-rnu mirr-u-m* +
_bring.aux-pst 3s-erg bread-nom 3pl-ori bring-an-3rd_ +
He brought the bread to them.
====

// TODO: these are wrong - can't generate T in V'

====
*k-i panwa-ø wi yirr-a-m* +
_burn.aux-pres fire-erg 0.val.1 burn-inan-3rd_ +
The fire burns.
====

However, for pragmatic reasons the speaker may move the verb's auxiliary
from its regular position at the beginning of the clause to after the
verb's arguments. It must appear _after_ any valence modifiers to avoid
violating the verb phrase rules.

====
*kurru-l wa-j ji k-i wurr-u-ø* +
_2s-acc 1s-nom 0.val.2 strike.aux-pres electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.

*wa-j kurru-l ji k-i wurr-u-ø* +
_1s-nom 2s-acc 0.val.2 strike.aux-pres electrically.storm-an-1st_ +
I strike you.
====

=== Noun phrase

====
_NP = N'_ +
_N' = N (CP)_
====

A verb phrase can take more than just bare nouns. A _noun phrase_ is a
constituent which acts like a noun. It can contain the noun alone, but
can also be modified by a relative clause.

The relative clause always appears at the end of the noun phrase

====
*birru-ø* +
_sea-erg_ +
sea
====

====
*kanaama yirlirna-j gu* +
_woven basket-nom small_ +
small woven basket
====

=== Adpositional phrases

=== Comparatives

A comparative is a sentence which compares one noun to another, using an
adjective. Ngujari uses _locational-type comparatives_ which are
verbless. The noun to be judged against (the _standard noun_) is given
a locational case, while the noun that is being judged is given the case
that it would assume as the subject of an intransitive verb. The two
nouns are then followed by the adjective, which is in the predicate form
(see *morphology*).

If the judged noun is 'more' of the adjective than the standard noun,
the revertive case is used. If they are the same, the locative case is
used.

====
*nna-j wa-rna yam-u* +
_3s-nom 1s-rev tall-an_ +
He is taller than me.

*gungaa-ø muyu-rn yurli-la* +
_axe-erg spear-loc dull-inan_ +
The axe and spear are equally as dull.
====

Comparatives may be used in relative clauses. The adjective becomes the
first word in the clause and is followed by the nouns. One of the nouns
is replaced by a pronoun as usual.

====
*k-a nnalji-ø junn-u nna-ø wiinguurki-rna yuki-j ka giirr-u-m* +
_win.aux-pst dingo-erg fast-an 3s-erg boy-rev race-nom 2.val.1 win-an-3rd_ +
The dingo, who is faster than the boy, won the race.
====

=== Modifier Positioning

==== Adjectives

// TODO

==== Adverbs

Adverbs can be split into two categories:

* Temporal adverbs specify the time a verb takes place
* Manner adverbs detail the manner in which the verb was conducted

Temporal adverbs usually follow the base verb.

====
*k-a jana-ø jari-rn wiirr-uu-ø yuurli-rna ma* +
_go.aux-pst 1s.ch-erg beach-loc go-ch-1st day-rev one_ +
Yesterday, I [a child] went to the beach.
====

Manner adverbs usually precede the base verb.

====
*nn-uuki-yii waya-ø pirwa-pirwa-j garrna gann-u-ø* +
_pickup.aux-fut-wimp 1pl-erg clothing-pl-nom quickly pickup-an-1st_ +
We should pick up the clothes quickly.
====

However, both can occupy different positions inside the verb phrase if
the speaker desires it.
