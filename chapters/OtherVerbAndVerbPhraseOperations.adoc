== Other verb and verb-phrase operations

=== Nominalisation

A verb is nominalised by adding its final vowel and a relevant suffix.

==== Action nominalisation

Occurs when a verb is nominalised to a noun representing its action.

The nominalisation is usually morphological but in some exceptions is lexical.

The gerund of a verb serves two purposes. It can act in a way similar to
the English gerund, where the verb is used as a noun, or in a way
similar to an infinitive, meaning roughly "in order to".

The gerund is formed through nominalising the verb. The last vowel of
the verb is simply appended as a suffix.

When used in the nominal form, the gerund takes the appropriate noun
case.

====
*k-arlu wa-j junnu yuurr-u-Ã¸* +
_like.aux-rem 1s-nom swim.ger like-an-1st_ +
I used to like swimming.
====

// maybe not, check clauses
// In the infinitive form, the gerund is placed before the verb's
// auxiliary.
//
// ====
// *parra k-a nni-j naarla wiirr-u-m* +
// _hunt.ger go.aux-pst 3s.an-nom there go-an-3rd_ +
// He went there to hunt.
// ====

==== Participant nominalisation

Ngujari supports agent nominalisation, in which the verb is nominalised to refer
to its agne.t This is an almost completely productive operation.

// TODO: add exceptions

The suffix _ngu_ (person) is added to nominalise the verb.

Instrument nominalisation is a syntactic process, that uses the demonstrative
pronoun as a clause's agent.

====
_DEMPRON-INAN-ERG coffee.ABS grind-INAN-3RD_ +
coffee grinder (lit. "that which grinds coffee")
====

// TODO: example of usage in a sentence

The verb must be in the present tense.

Locational nominalisation uses the suffix _nnalu_ (ground). A nominalised
location implicitly takes locative case, and is not marked if it does so. It can
be marked for revertive or orientative, but can take no other cases.

// TODO: change example in next line, it's from Describing Morphosyntax
In an agent nominalisation, there is no distinction between "classes" (e.g.
teacher) and "events" (e.g. the person currently teaching.)

=== Compounding/Incorporation

=== Tense/aspect/mode

=== Location/direction

=== Participant Reference

Verbs reference subject person and number through suffixes.

There are two situations in which participant reference is anaphoric (and the
verb can stand alone without a noun phrase subject).

Intransitive clauses where the reference has been preestablished.

====
_... ? cry-AN-3RD_ +
What does the monkey do? It cries.
====

Or where the subject is an animate pronoun.

====
_cry-AN-3RD_ +
He cries.
====

In the main clause of a clause chain, where the subject is an animate pronoun
and the only explicit argument to the final verb.

// TODO: see "car arrives" example

In other cases, participant reference is purely grammatical and the agreeing
noun phrase must be present.
