- [] System of movement nouns instead of oblique locational prepositions
- [] No verbal adjuncts - expressed through case instead
- [] Orientative and dative case are the same - e.g. in "gave X to Y-ORI"
- [] All languages have a construction that downplays centrality of A w.r.t. P
- [] Historically, ORI/REV suffixes were orginally verbs used in noun-verb incorporation but became suffixes
- [] Should negatives be in the subjunctive? + different person endings for irrealis moods
